For killing hanging processes on the acad server vvv
ps aux | grep vvel  ---> kill <process id>

./server 12345 & <--- to start a server
*look up how to put server in the background with bg

if server bound already then must use a different port
- use a 5 digit number not bigger than 65536

- look up man socket and man connect
- print out words until there arent any more packets
- word packet
    - size is 2 bytes big endian | x00 x05 H E L L O |
    - read in two bytes, turn that into an integer and then read that many more bytes

- Our machine most likely runs little endian so must pay attention 

*** ERROR CHECK YOU ARE GETTING CORRECT BYTES ***

- Zero indicates end of file in read() and recv()

- make a function for decoding bytes
- using socket() protocol is 0 

- make a socket, connect the socket, read from the socket, close the socket (close() and error check)
