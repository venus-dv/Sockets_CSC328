For killing hanging processes on the acad server vvv
ps aux | grep vvel  ---> kill <process id>

./server 12345 & <--- to start a server
*look up how to put server in the background with bg

1. accept two command line arguments: host and port in that order.
2. create a socket
3. connect the socket to the server
4.  read word packets until the server closes the connection. for each word packet print the associated string to standard out followed by a newline.
5. close the socket file descriptor

if server bound already then must use a different port
- use a 5 digit number not bigger than 65536

- look up man socket and man connect
- print out words until there arent any more packets
- word packet
    - size is 2 bytes big endian | x00 x05 H E L L O |
    - read in two bytes, turn that into an integer and then read that many more bytes

- Our machine most likely runs little endian so must pay attention 

*** ERROR CHECK YOU ARE GETTING CORRECT BYTES ***

- Zero indicates end of file in read() and recv()

- make a function for decoding bytes
- using socket() protocol is 0 

- make a socket, connect the socket, read from the socket, close the socket (close() and error check)
